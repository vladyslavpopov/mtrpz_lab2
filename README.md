# Custom Lists Implementation with Unit Testing  

This project implements two types of lists:  
- **Array-based List** (based on built-in arrays)  
- **Circular Singly Linked List** (a custom implementation without built-in collections)  

Both implementations include basic list operations and are covered by unit tests.  

## Variant  
Variant is calculated as follows:  
Student's number in the group list: 18

`18 mod 4 = 2 => Variant 2`

Variant 2 requires implementing **a list based on built-in arrays** and **a circular singly linked list**

## Conclusions

Unit tests are useful for verifying the correctness of the code.
- They help detect errors before deploying the code in real applications.
- Automated testing via CI saves time by continuously validating functionality.
- Writing tests takes extra time, but it pays off, especially when modifying the code.

Unit testing is not a waste of time — it’s a valuable tool for maintaining code quality.
